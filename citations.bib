	abstract = {According to the central limit theorem, the means of a random sample of size, n, from a population with mean, µ, and variance, σ2, distribute normally with mean, µ, and variance, [Formula: see text]. Using the central limit theorem, a variety of parametric tests have been developed under assumptions about the parameters that determine the population probability distribution. Compared to non-parametric tests, which do not require any assumptions about the population probability distribution, parametric tests produce more accurate and precise estimates with higher statistical powers. However, many medical researchers use parametric tests to present their data without knowledge of the contribution of the central limit theorem to the development of such tests. Thus, this review presents the basic concepts of the central limit theorem and its role in binomial distributions and the Student's t-test, and provides an example of the sampling distributions of small populations. A proof of the central limit theorem is also described with the mathematical concepts required for its near-complete understanding.},

	volume = {13},
	issn = {0250-7005},
	abstract = {In recent years a 4-mutation paradigm for carcinogenesis was developed for mutations in tumour suppressor genes. The major tenet of this paradigm is that transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell is the result of an accumulation of a set of 4 specific cancer mutations. In this paper we show that this paradigm can explain the characteristic differences between benign and malignant tumours. We surmise that benign tumour cells are due to 2 or 3 specific cancer mutations, whereas malignant tumour cells contain 4 specific cancer mutations and 1-3 tumour progression mutations. The following characteristics, essential for differentiating benign and malignant tumours, are explained by our paradigm: (a) differentiation--anaplasia, (b) rate of growth, (c) encapsulation--invasion, (d) metastasis, and (e) the differences in size of benign epithelial and mesenchymal tumours and the relation between tumour size and malignancy.},

	abstract = {Breast Cancer ({BC}) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of mortality among women. About 1 in 8 {US} women (about 13\%) will develop invasive {BC} throughout their lifetime. Early detection of this life-threatening disease not only increases the survival rate but also reduces the treatment cost. Fortunately, advancements in radiographic imaging like "Mammograms", "Computed Tomography ({CT})", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI})", "3D Mammography", and "Histopathological Imaging ({HI})" have made it feasible to diagnose this life-taking disease at an early stage. However, the analysis of radiographic images and Histopathological images is done by experienced radiologists and pathologists, respectively. The process is not only costly but also error-prone. Over the last ten years, Computer Vision and Machine Learning ({ML}) have transformed the world in every way possible. Deep learning ({DL}), a subfield of {ML} has shown outstanding results in a variety of fields, particularly in the biomedical industry, because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. {DL} techniques automatically extract the features by analyzing the high dimensional and correlated data efficiently. The potential and ability of {DL} models have also been utilized and evaluated in the identification and prognosis of {BC}, utilizing radiographic and Histopathological images, and have performed admirably. However, {AI} has shown good claims in retrospective studies only. External validations are needed for translating these cutting-edge {AI} tools as a clinical decision maker. The main aim of this research work is to present the critical analysis of the research and findings already done to detect and classify {BC} using various imaging modalities including "Mammography", "Histopathology", "Ultrasound", "{PET}/{CT}", "{MRI}", and "Thermography". At first, a detailed review of the past research papers using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for {BC} classification and detection is carried out. We also review the publicly available datasets for the above-mentioned imaging modalities to make future research more accessible. Finally, a critical discussion section has been included to elaborate open research difficulties and prospects for future study in this emerging area, demonstrating the limitations of Deep Learning approaches.},

{PURPOSE}: In this review, we examine studies that have used these techniques for breast cancer classification and diagnosis, focusing on five groups of medical images: mammography, ultrasound, {MRI}, histology, and thermography. We discuss the use of five popular machine learning techniques, including Nearest Neighbor, {SVM}, Naive Bayesian Network, {DT}, and {ANN}, as well as deep learning architectures and convolutional neural networks.
{CONCLUSION}: Our review finds that machine learning and deep learning techniques have achieved high accuracy rates in breast cancer classification and diagnosis across various medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, these techniques have the potential to improve clinical decision-making and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.},
